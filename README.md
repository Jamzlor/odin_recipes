# odin_recipes
Odin recipes will be my first webpage, utilizing my knowledge in HTML.

Specifically
- Boilerplate
- Title
- Using headers to separate the information into readable sections
- Effectively use em tags for italics and strong tags for bold letterings
- Effectively use ordered list to create steps
- Effectively use unordered list to create a shoping cart
- Use comments to plan and structure the webpage

The following section is for self reflection once the project is completed
- While creating the webpage, I realize strong tag does not work on Header tag text but em tag works
    - in order to counter this, I used the p tag rather than header tags to implement the bold fonts
- I have also added an img tag with a photo of the chosen recipe as well
